The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

The SimpleToDo app is a very easy app to understand. It uses an android library to help store data to a local file system. 
I had a small amount of trouble getting the ID's for the EditActivity button and textview but it was just a small error and was found
relatively quickly.
